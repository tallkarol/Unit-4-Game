# Balance Your Chakras
- Do you have the mathmatical skills to achieve numerical nirvana, or will you bust on your quest towards the 'Perfect Score'.

# The rules of the game are simple:
- The target of the game is to use the power of the crystals to bring 'Your Score' to equal the 'Perfect Score'.
- By clicking a combination of the four crystals, the player uses their power to accumulate points.
- Similar to blackjack, if you can match the 'Perfect Score' then you win, if you go over, you lose.
- After a win or loss, the game is restarted with a new 'Perfect Score' and new values for the strengths of the crystals.

# Why the project is useful:
- It really isn't all that useful. But it was a way to continue to practice my skills which in the end is always useful (to me at least).


# How users can get started with the project:
- Take a look at the 'Perfect Score' and begin clicking crystals, taking notice of the power of each individual crystal as you click.
- Use the power of these crystals to bring balance to the scores and achieve numerical nirvana, or bust and feel the shame of restarting the game with a L staring back at you.
